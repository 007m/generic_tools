Here's a list of instructions to help you diagnose a possible connectivity problem if you are operating on a UNIX system:
Open a terminal or command prompt with administrative privileges.
Run the following command to set the default policy for the INPUT chain to DROP:
bash
sudo iptables -P INPUT DROP
Set the default policy for the FORWARD chain to DROP:
bash
sudo iptables -P FORWARD DROP
Allow loopback traffic to ensure local processes can communicate:
bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
Allow established and related connections to maintain existing sessions:
bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
Save the iptables rules to make them persistent:
bash
sudo iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4
Monitor system logs for any connection attempts or errors:
bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog
Use network diagnostic tools like ping, traceroute, or mtr to test connectivity to various destinations.
Check the status of network interfaces:
bash
ip addr show
Monitor network traffic using tools like tcpdump or Wireshark to analyze packets.
Test DNS resolution by attempting to resolve domain names:
bash
nslookup example.com
Verify that critical services are still running and accessible locally.
Gradually re-enable specific connections by adding ACCEPT rules for necessary services and ports.
Document all findings and observed behavior during the connectivity blackout.
Once diagnosis is complete, restore normal connectivity by setting the default policies back to ACCEPT:
bash
sudo iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT
sudo iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT
